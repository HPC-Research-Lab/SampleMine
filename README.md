## Reproduce the results in the paper. 

To reproduce the results in the paper, please follow the instructions in README.md in [pattern_mining](https://github.com/HPC-Research-Lab/SampleMine/tree/main/pattern_mining) directory. This README.md only offered the general execution instructions. 

## Overview

SampleMine is a general-purpose system for subgraph pattern mining based on subgraph enumeration and sampling. Example tasks that SampleMine supports are:

* **Subgraph Counting**: Counting the embeddings of different subgraph patterns and find the patterns with the largest counts. 
* **Frequent Subgraph Mining**: Obtaining all frequent subgraph patterns from a labeled input graph based on MNI support. 
* **User-Defined Queries**: Finding subgraphs that meet the constraints specified by the users.
